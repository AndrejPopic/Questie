Refactor: Migrate to Jetpack Compose Navigation and improve UI
This commit implements Jetpack Compose Navigation to manage different screens and refactors the UI components for better structure and navigation.

-   **Navigation:**
    - Implemented a navigation graph using `NavHost` to manage navigation between `HomeScreen`, `FamilyTree`, `QuestsReport` and `SettingsScreen`.
    - Integrated a bottom navigation bar in `Nav` with icons for `home`, `family tree` and `quests report` to switch between screens.
    - `BottomNav` deleted.
-   **UI Components:**
    - Created `QuestsRow` as a reusable component for displaying quests in list and replaced `HomeScreen` and `QuestsRow`.
    - Created `FamilyRow` as a reusable component for displaying family in list.
    - Created `HomeScreen` that will display `QuestsRow` in list.
    - Created `FamilyTree` that will display `FamilyRow` in list.
    - Created `QuestsReport` that will display `QuestsRow` in list.
    - Created `SettingsScreen` that will display `QuestsRow` in list.
    - Created `SettingsList` data class.
    - Created `rememberSettingsState` composable function.
    - Added icons for navigation bar, user, arrow, family tree and quest report.
- **Gradle**
    - Added navigation-compose dependency.
- **Removals**
    - Removed old `HomeScreen`.

These changes allow for a more modular and maintainable codebase, as well as provide a more complete and user-friendly navigation experience.
